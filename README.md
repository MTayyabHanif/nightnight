# night night
nightnight is a simple program that allows you to put your website to sleep, encouraging your users to go to sleep better supporting their health and well being.

The project seeks to highlight issues of sleep debt, how technology contributes to these issues, and to engage technology creators with New Kind of Design and the concept of Universal Responsibility.

nightnight was created for Masamichi Souzou by the team at Neeley Worldwide.

# Install

There are two ways to install nightnight on your website.

<code>
<script async=true src="https://wwww.neeleyworldwide.com/0100/0400/nightnight.js"></script>
</code>

We suggest 6am '0600' and 10pm '2200' as default wake and sleep time, but you can adjust these simply by changing the times in the script above. For example if we want to wake up at 6:30am and 11pm then the script is adjusted to the following. 

<code>
<script async=true src="https://wwww.neeleyworldwide.com/0630/2300/nightnight.js"></script>
</code>


The second option is to host all of the pages on your site.
<code>
<script>
var d = new Date();
if (d.getHours() >= 6 && d.getHours() <= 22) {
  $(".open").show();
  $(".nightnight").hide();
} else {
  $(".nightnight").show();
  $(".open").hide();
}
</script>
</code>

#### Masamichi Souzou

mmsz is a New Kind of Company, working to solve for human happiness through the consideration of everything. Globally, current business & design practicies tend to optimize for profit and fail to consider the larger cummulative impact of these activities over time, which can inveitably lead to catastrophic collapse of systems, like the obesity epedemic, global finacial instability, and climate change. We believe there are solutions. Masamichi Souzou (正道想像) is Japanese for "Correct Path, Imagined/Created." At mmsz want to know what the world would look like if we optimize everything, not for profit or growth, but for happiness. We are building that world.
